# Wii Test Cards

Test card generator for the Wii. 

Supported Cards:
- SMPTE Engineering Guideline EG 1:1990
- EBU Colour Bars
- Telefunken FuBK (semi complete)

Features:
- Test Card is generated from the proportions of the screen so it works in 4:3 and 16:9 mode.
- ~~(kinda broken)~~ (fixed!) Brightness Setting (Up/Down to increase and decrease, B to reset)
- Switching between Test Cards (Left/Right)

Features I'm planning on adding:
- Philips Circle Patterns
- Some of the grayscale ones (Telefunken T05, Test Card B/C, etc.)
- Contrast Setting
- maybe i could attempt to design my own test card
