# Wii Test Cards

SMPTE test card generator for the Wii. 

Features:
- Test Card is generated from the proportions of the screen so it works in 4:3 and 16:9 mode.
- ~~(kinda broken)~~ (fixed!) Brightness Setting (Up/Down to increase and decrease, B to reset)

Features I'm planning on adding:
- Philips Circle Patterns
- EBU Colour Bars
- Telefunken FuBK (which is pretty much just PM5544 no offence germany)
- Some of the grayscale ones (Telefunken T05, Test Card B/C, etc.)
- Contrast Setting
- maybe i could attempt to design my own test card
